This project focuses on solving randomly generated **mazes** using two fundamental search algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS).**

## üîç Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**BFS** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices in the order of their distance from the starting point, ensuring that all nodes at the current depth level are visited before moving to the next level.

-   **Data Structure Used:** Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out).
    
-   **Traversal Strategy:** Starting from the **root** node, BFS visits all neighboring nodes. Then, for each of those nearest nodes, it explores their unexplored neighbors, and so on. This process continues until all nodes have been visited.
    
-   **Shortest Path:** In unweighted graphs, BFS guarantees the **shortest path** from the starting node to all other nodes.
    
**Time and Space Complexity:**

-   **Time Complexity:** O (V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
    
-   **Space Complexity:** O (V), due to the storage of vertices in the queue.

## üîç Depth-First Search (DFS)

**DFS** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, diving deep into the graph's branches.

-   **Data Structure Used:** Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out), which can be implemented using recursion.
    
-   **Traversal Strategy:** Starting from the **root** node, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This means it goes **deep** into the graph and backtracks when it hits a node with no unvisited neighbors.
    
-   **Path Finding:** DFS does **not** guarantee the shortest path in graphs.
    
**Time and Space Complexity:**

-   **Time Complexity:** O (V + E), similar to BFS.
    
-   **Space Complexity:** O (V) in the worst case, due to the storage of vertices in the stack or recursion call stack.

- `MazeGenerator.java`: Handles the procedural generation of the maze.

### üîç `src/algorithms/`
Implements the search algorithms used to solve the maze:

- `BFS.java`: Implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
- `DFS.java`: Implements the Depth-First Search algorithm.

### üñ•Ô∏è `src/gui/`
Manages the graphical user interface components:

- `MazePanel.java`: Responsible for rendering the maze and the solution paths.
- `MainFrame.java`: Sets up the main application window and integrates all components.
